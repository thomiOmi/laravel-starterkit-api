# Creating Custom AI Skills & Rules

This project uses the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format for domain-specific AI knowledge. Skills are loaded on-demand; guidelines are loaded upfront.

## Guidelines vs Skills

| | Guidelines | Skills |
|---|---|---|
| Location | `.ai/guidelines/*.md` | `.ai/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` |
| Loaded | Upfront, always present | On-demand, when task matches description |
| Scope | Broad conventions (e.g, coding standards, architecture) | Focused domain knowledge (e.g, testing, permissions, social auth) |

## Creating a Skill

### 1. Directory structure

```text
.ai/skills/{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: YAML frontmatter + metadata + instructions

├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code

├── references/       # Optional: documentation

├── assets/           # Optional: templates, resources

└── ...               # Any additional files or directories

```

### 2. SKILL.md format

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Clear description of what this skill does and when to use it. Include keywords for matching.
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
---
```

Name rules:
- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Max 64 characters
- Must match the parent directory name

Description rules:
- Max 1024 characters
- Describe both what and when

### 3. Progressive disclosure

Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to `references/`.

```markdown
See [the reference guide](references/detail.md) for full documentation.
```

More details. See [specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), [best practices](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/best-practices), [optimizing descriptions](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/optimizing-descriptions), [using scripts](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/using-scripts)

## Creating a Guideline

Add `.md` files to `.ai/guidelines/`. Guidelines are loaded upfront, so keep them concise (under 100 lines).

```text
.ai/guidelines/
├── general.md           # Project conventions (tech stack, API, testing, code quality)

├── creating-skills.md   # This file

└── ...                  # Any additional guidelines

```

## Managing with Boost

Run `php artisan boost:update --discover` to install Boost-provided guidelines and skills. All custom files in `.ai/` are preserved.

## Existing Skills

| Skill | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `laravel-attributes` | `.ai/skills/laravel-attributes/` | PHP 8 attributes for Laravel models, jobs, commands, form requests |
| `modular-architecture` | `.ai/skills/modular-architecture/` | Module DDD structure: Actions, Builders, Controllers, Payloads, Requests, Resources |
| `create-prd` | `.ai/skills/create-prd/` | PRD creation from `docs/prd/template.md` with clarifying questions |
| `create-adr` | `.ai/skills/create-adr/` | Architecture Decision Records in Nygard format from `docs/adr/template.md` |
| `update-tasks` | `.ai/skills/update-tasks/` | TASKS.md operational tracker maintenance |

Use the `skill` tool to load a skill when the task matches its description. List all available skills with the `available_skills` list in the system prompt.

# Laravel Standard Coding Guidelines

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
| --- | --- |
| Framework | Laravel 13 + PHP 8.4 |
| Database | MySQL |
| Package manager | Composer 2.9+ |
| Auth | Laravel Sanctum (token-based) |
| Role/Permission | Spatie `laravel-permission` |
| Social Auth | Laravel Socialite |
| Feature Flags | Laravel Pennant |

## Project Philosophy

| Principle | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Production-ready, not overengineered** | Every abstraction must solve a real problem. Do not build config files, middleware, or services for scenarios that do not exist yet. Prefer inline code with a default over a configurable flag that is never changed. |
| **Laravel-native first** | Use built-in Laravel features before introducing custom code or new dependencies. Convention over configuration is the default — only extract to config when the value changes between environments or is consumed by 3+ call sites. |
| **Module isolation** | Modules communicate through contracts, not through direct imports. Keep the core (IAM) minimal and let feature modules extend it. |
| **Explicit over magic** | Route middleware, authorization, and validation should be visible in the route definition and Form Request, not hidden in service providers or auto-discovery. |
| **Maintainability over cleverness** | Favor flat structures, final readonly classes, and explicit type hints. Code is written once and read many times. |

## API Convention

| Aspect | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Base URL | `/api/v1/...` (lowercase) |
| Auth | `Authorization: Bearer {token}` (Sanctum) |
| Response | `SuccessResponse` / `ProblemResponse` — `{status, title?, detail?, data, meta?}` (NO `success` boolean) |
| Error | `ProblemResponse` — RFC 9457 |
| Date format | `Y-m-d H:i:s` |
| Route names | `v1.{module}.{name}` |

## Project Rules (`.ai/rules/`)

Area-specific conventions (testing, controllers, actions, models, routes, responses, database) live in `.ai/rules/` and are matched to files by glob. Read the rule files matching your work before editing. When a settled convention is not yet recorded, record it with `record-rule` so the next agent inherits it.

## Quality Gates

- After writing PHP code: `composer lint:staged` (pre-commit) or `composer lint` (all files)
- Then: `composer rector:dry`
- Then: `composer types:check` (phpstan)
- Run tests: `composer test` (pest, unit + feature) and `composer test:profanity`
- Before pushing: `composer ci:check` (runs lint:check -> rector:dry -> types:check -> test -> test:profanity in order)
- Coverage, mutation, and type-coverage gates are temporarily suspended (scripts removed); re-enable once the suite stabilizes
- Fix all errors in code (do NOT modify `phpstan.neon`); do NOT use `@phpstan-ignore` — fix the root cause instead
- Follow existing code conventions — check sibling files and `.ai/rules/` before creating new ones
- Every change must have a corresponding test

## Architecture Test Rules (`tests/Architecture/ArchitectureTest.php`)

- **DO NOT** modify `ArchitectureTest.php` unless explicitly instructed by the user
- If architecture tests fail due to code changes, **report the failure to the user** and let them decide how to proceed — do NOT auto-fix or auto-ignore the rule
- The architecture test file is the project's single source of truth for conventions; changes require deliberate human approval

## Agentic Development (Laravel Boost & Agent Skills)

- **Laravel Boost**: Accelerates development with framework-specific guidelines and MCP tools (`search-docs`, `database-schema`, etc.).
- **Agent Skills**: Uses the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) format for domain-specific expertise.
- **Location**: Guidelines in `.ai/guidelines/`, Skills in `.ai/skills/`.
- **Activation**: Guidelines are loaded upfront; Skills are activated on-demand via triggers (`skill` tool).
- **Update**: Run `php artisan boost:update --discover` to sync/re-apply all guidelines and skills.

## File Ownership Rules

| File/Dir | Managed by | Edit via |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | Laravel Boost (auto-generated) | **DO NOT** edit directly — edit `.ai/guidelines/` or `.ai/skills/` instead |
| `.ai/guidelines/` | You (survives `boost:update`) | Edit directly — source files for AGENTS.md guidelines section |
| `.ai/rules/` | Boost `record-rule` + you | Record via `record-rule`; hand-edits allowed but keep `index.md` in sync |
| `.ai/skills/` | You (survives `boost:update`) | Edit directly — Boost-managed agent skills |
| `.agents/` | AI agent's skill/rules system | **DO NOT** edit directly — let the AI agent manage it |

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to ensure the best experience when building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application running on PHP 8.4. You are an expert with the Laravel ecosystem. Always use the APIs that match the installed major version of each package — do not assume a version.

Before relying on a package's API, confirm its installed version:
- PHP packages: run `composer show --direct` to list direct dependencies with versions, or `composer show <vendor/package>` for a single package.
- JS packages: check `package.json` for the installed versions.

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Always use `search-docs` before making code changes. Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Project Rules

- This project contains committed, area-grouped rules in `.ai/rules` when that directory exists (settled decisions, non-obvious traps, standing constraints). Framework and package guidelines that only apply to specific paths (testing, frontend, components) also live there, under `.ai/rules/boost` — this is not just recorded decisions, it is load-bearing guidance you have not seen inline. Before you enter plan mode or create/edit any file, you MUST first: open @.ai/rules/index.md (it maps file globs to rule files), read every rule file whose globs cover the path(s) in scope, and run `grep -rin 'keyword' .ai/rules` to catch what a path match alone misses. Do not write code until you have read and are following every matching rule. If `.ai/rules` does not exist, continue without it.
- Record durable rules with `record-rule` so the next agent or teammate inherits them instead of working them out again. Pass a `glob` (e.g. `app/Http/Controllers/**`), a short `title`, and a few-line `note`. Always use `record-rule`, never your native memory or notes tool — native memory is personal and session-scoped; only `.ai/rules` is shared with the team and persists in the repo.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- The `{name}` argument should not include the test suite directory. Use `php artisan make:test --pest SomeFeatureTest` instead of `php artisan make:test --pest Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.

=== pestphp/pest-plugin-agent/core rules ===

## Pest Agent Plugin

`vendor/bin/pest --agent="<code>"` runs a one-off Pest assertion without creating a test file — the fastest way to verify that a change actually works (a route response, a model relationship, a rendered page, a form submission, mail firing, a screenshot, JavaScript errors, and so on).

### ALWAYS load the skill first

Whenever the user asks you to check, verify, confirm, or "make sure" something **works** — and it can be exercised on a route, page, form, model, job, mail, notification, or screenshot — you **MUST** load the **`pest-plugin-agent` skill before doing anything else**. Do not reach for a shell command, a throwaway test file, or manual reasoning first. This includes prompts like "verify the login form works", "did my change break X", "screenshot the homepage", "check this route returns 200", "make sure the mail fires", "is the form working", or any behavioral check after a Blade, Livewire, CSS, or JS change. Load the skill, then follow it exactly.

### NEVER fight shell escaping — use SINGLE outer quotes

Inline the snippet, but wrap it in **single** quotes, not double. Single quotes tell the shell to interpret nothing, so `$variables`, `\App\Models\User`, backticks, and `!` all pass through to PHP literally — **there is nothing to escape.** Use double quotes for PHP string literals inside:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest --agent='$user = \App\Models\User::factory()->create(); visit("/login")->type("email", $user->email)->press("Log in")->assertPathIs("/dashboard");'
```

Double outer quotes are the trap the shell springs on you — `--agent="…$user…"` makes the shell interpolate `$user` to nothing. Never do that, and never hand-escape `\$`.

The one thing single quotes can't contain is a literal single quote (an apostrophe in the PHP). Only then, fall back to a file: **Write** the snippet to a `.php` file (plain body statements — no `<?php`, no `use`, fully qualified class names) and run `vendor/bin/pest --agent="$(cat /path/to/snippet.php)"`. `"$(cat …)"` passes the contents verbatim without re-parsing. The plugin resolves the test suite's `uses`/namespace itself, so the file's location does not matter (a scratch/temp path is fine — it need not live under `tests/`).

### Browser checks require the browser plugin — ask before installing

Whenever the request can only be answered in a real browser — "does login work", "is the page responsive", "screenshot the homepage", "check the mobile layout", "does the button click through", "are there JS/console errors", or any visual/interaction check — the `visit()` browser API is needed. It comes from a **separate** package, `pestphp/pest-plugin-browser`, which is powered by Playwright.

If `visit()` is undefined (or the package is not installed), **do not install it silently — ask the user for permission first**, since it pulls in Node/Playwright dependencies and downloads browser binaries. Explain that the browser check needs it and confirm before running these commands:

```bash
composer require pestphp/pest-plugin-browser --dev   # the browser plugin (needs Node.js)

npm install playwright@latest                         # Playwright driver

npx playwright install                                # download the browser binaries

```

Once the user approves and it's installed, add `tests/Browser/Screenshots` to `.gitignore` so captured screenshots aren't committed. Browser assertions then run through the same `vendor/bin/pest --agent='…'` flow:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest --agent='visit("/login")->type("email", "test@example.com")->type("password", "password")->press("Log in")->assertPathIs("/dashboard");'
vendor/bin/pest --agent='visit("/")->on()->mobile()->screenshot(fullPage: false, filename: "home-mobile");'
```

For full usage — backend examples, browser testing, screenshots, responsive checks, combining frontend and backend assertions, RefreshDatabase guidance, and pitfalls — load the **`pest-plugin-agent` skill**.
